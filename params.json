  "body": "### About Software Workouts\r\nSoftware Workouts is a bi-weekly community-driven seminar hosted at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.eoas.ubc.ca/) on scientific computing techniques and best practices. The seminar has been active since fall 2014 and is designed in part as an extension to [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/). Most of the material presented has direct connections to the research pursued by the participants. To receive emails about upcoming Workouts, please contact [Dr. Susan Allen](http://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~sallen/).\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nWe meet every other Thursday at 1pm in room 5106 of the UBC Earth Sciences Building\r\n##### Upcoming Workouts\r\nDate | Title | Presenter\r\n---- | ----- | ---------\r\n5 May 2016 | Planning meeting for next term |\r\n\r\n##### Past Workouts\r\nDate | Title | Presenter\r\n---- | ----- | ---------\r\n21 Apr 2016 | Creating Websites with Git and GitHub | Doug\r\n7 Apr 2016 | SQLAlechemy | Elise\r\n24 Mar 2016 | [Working with dates and times](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.eoas.ubc.ca/~bmoorema/datetime_workout.ipynb) | Ben\r\n10 Mar 2016 | Introduction to Sympy | Karina\r\n11 Feb 2016 | More on Editors [Sublime/Atom](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.eoas.ubc.ca/~dlatorne/swc/2016-01-28-bash-editors/BashEditorsCustomization-DJL.ipynb) Emacs | Doug and Ben\r\n28 Jan 2016 | [Bash](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.eoas.ubc.ca/~bmoorema/Bash_Emacs_Workout.ipynb) and Tour d'Editors | Ben, Cindy, Doug\r\n14 Jan 2016 | Code review | Elise and Doug\r\n10 Sep 2015 | Debugger | Doug\r\n27 Aug 2015 | Makefiles | Susan\r\n13 Aug 2015 | Data Frames (pandas) | Nancy\r\n30 Jul 2015 | Bokeh | Julia\r\n16 Jul 2015 | Cloud Computing | Doug\r\n 2 Jul 2015 | Tests/Errors and Assertions | Bill\r\n18 Jun 2015 | MPI | Henryk\r\n28 May 2015 | argparse | Kang\r\n21 May 2015 | python packages | Elise\r\n23 Apr 2015 | Fortran, different versions, how to run, how to read | Susan\r\n 9 Apr 2015 | ssh, scp, sftp, at and cron (also ssh keys) | Rob and Susan\r\n26 Mar 2015 | maps in python | Nancy\r\n12 Mar 2015 | object oriented programming | Jordan\r\n26 Feb 2015 | GRIB, netcdf and hdf files | Drew and Kang\r\n12 Feb 2015 | code review: python scripts from the command line and piping one to the next | Kang\r\n29 Jan 2015 | awk and other textfile manipulations | Kathi\r\n 4 Dec 2014 | Wrappers | Phil Austin\r\n20 Nov 2014 | Creating modules in python | Nancy\r\n 6 Nov 2014 | Shell commands from Matlab, Matlab scripts from the command line, shell commands from ipython | Divya, Drew and Susan\r\n23 Oct 2014 | animations in Python | Nancy and Idalia\r\n 9 Oct 2014 | pandas in ipython notebooks to read real EOAS data | Susan\r\n",
