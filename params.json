  "body": "### About Software Workouts\r\nSoftware Workouts is a bi-weekly community-driven seminar hosted at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.eoas.ubc.ca/) on scientific computing techniques and best practices. The seminar has been active since fall 2014 and is designed in part as an extension to [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/). Most of the material presented has direct connections to the research pursued by the participants. To receive emails about upcoming Workouts, please contact [Dr. Susan Allen](http://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~sallen/).\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
